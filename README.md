# AWS Application

This project is in-progress, I am using AWS tools to build an image/video detection and processing application

## Overview
Explore the creation of a scalable image/video detection-recognition system on AWS. Utilizing Java and Spring Boot, the backend application showcases engaging features like *identify-me*, *find-similarity*, *face/emotion-details*, and *celebrity look-alike*, with applications across various industries. The project leverages over 20 AWS services, spanning development, monitoring, performance, deployment, AI/NLP, and serverless functionalities like Fargate.
